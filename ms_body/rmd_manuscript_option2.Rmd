  Traditional forms of agriculture have created and preserved heterogeneous landscapes characterized by semi-natural meadows and pastures, which have high conversation value for biodiversity. Landscapes in Central and Eastern European countries with traditional agriculture are a stronghold for pollinators, butterflies and amphibians, which have declined in other parts of Europe. Despite different landscape structures, agriculture-associated pesticide exposure in streams can be similarly high as in Western Europe. This raises the question whether the heterogeneous landscape can buffer a temporary water quality decline by agriculture. We investigated the influence of landscape heterogeneity and water quality, in particular pesticide exposure, on macroinvertebrate communities in 19 small streams in Central Romania. We sampled the macroinvertebrate community, assessed the ecosystem function of leaf litter decomposition and analyzed the parasite prevalence in *Baetis* sp. and *Gammarus balcanicus*. No association between pesticide toxicity towards macroinvertebrates and several macroinvertebrate metrics was found. However, the level of pesticide toxicity was generally high, constituting a rather short gradient, and the pesticide indicator SPEAR~pesticides~ implied pesticide-driven community change in all sites. Landscape heterogeneity and forested upstream sections were among the most important drivers for the macroinvertebrate metrics, indicating increased dispersal and recolonization success. Agricultural land use in the catchment was negatively associated with vulnerable macroinvertebrate taxa such as Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. *G. balcanicus* dominated the shredder taxa and its abundance was positively associated with the pesticide indicator SPEAR~pesticides~. Parasite prevalence in *G. balcanicus* increased with extensive land use (pastures and forests), whereas it decreased with arable land. Our results suggest that heterogeneous landscapes with structures of low-intensive land use may buffer the effects of agricultural land use and facilitate dispersal and recolonization processes of pesticide-affected macroinvertebrate communities.

# Introduction
Despite a turnover in the spectrum of compounds and changes in regulation, high pesticide exposure remains widespread in inland waters, especially in small water bodies such as streams of Strahler orders of four and below [@strahler_quantitative_1957; @szocs_large_2017]. Studies in the last decades have repeatedly reported the exceedance of ecological and regulatory thresholds in small agricultural streams [@liess_pesticides_2021; @schulz_field_2004; @schafer_responses_2019]. Freshwater macroinvertebrates have been identified as an organism group at risk from pesticides in freshwater systems [@malaj_organic_2014]. In fact, several studies have linked pesticide exposure to a decrease in the fraction of vulnerable macroinvertebrates, using a metric developed to indicate pesticide stress (SPecies At Risk pesticide index, also called SPEAR~pesticides~) [@liess_analyzing_2005; @schafer_responses_2019; @liess_pesticides_2021]. Moreover, pesticide exposure can affect the fitness of exposed individuals and influence parasite prevalence in hosts, as shown for honey bees [@di_prisco_neonicotinoid_2013]. Furthermore, tadpole susceptibility to trematode infections increased after herbicide exposure, whereas trematode density increased after insecticide exposure [@rumschlag_effects_2019]. Parasites are important ecological players in ecosystems, and consequently, parasite abundance and diversity have been suggested as promising indicators for ecosystem health [@sures_parasites_2017]. Moreover, pesticide exposure has been associated with a decrease in leaf litter decomposition (LLD), a crucial ecosystem function in small streams [@schafer_effects_2012; @webster_spiraling_2007]. Overall, pesticides represent an important stressor for the freshwater macroinvertebrate communities and associated ecosystem functions in agricultural landscapes.

The composition of landscapes shapes habitats and dispersal processes, thereby influencing the distribution of species [@streib_how_2020; @lechner_characterising_2017]. In addition, it is closely linked to the effects of and recovery from pesticide exposure. On the one hand, the fraction of agriculture in a catchment has been identified as a major driver for pesticide exposure [@szocs_large_2017; @schreiner_paradise_2021]. On the other hand, less impacted areas, such as forests in a catchment provide recolonization patches for stream sections affected by stressors, including pesticides [@bunzel_landscape_2014; @orlinskiy_forested_2015]. From a theoretical perspective, both environmental selection, i.e. the selection of taxa based on environmental conditions, and dispersal, i.e. migration of taxa into habitat patches are important drivers of community assembly. Thus, the selection of taxa by pesticides and the related community change is an example of environmentally induced selection, whereas the recolonization of pesticide-affected habitat patches is mainly driven by dispersal [@leibold_metacommunity_2004]. Dispersal range greatly depends on habitat connectivity and permeability. Landscapes with geometrical complex habitat patches potentially provide more indirect habitat connections, resulting in a higher permeability and have been associated with increased plant species richness [@moser_landscape_2002; @streib_how_2020]. Several studies showed that the fraction of pesticide-vulnerable taxa (SPEAR~pesticides~ indicator taxa) was higher at sites with forested upstream sections (FUS) compared to sites without FUS [@bunzel_landscape_2014; @liess_analyzing_2005; @knillmann_indication_2018]. This points to recolonization through the dispersal of pesticide-vulnerable macroinvertebrates from FUS  [@bailey_observations_1966; @elliott_distances_1971; @orlinskiy_forested_2015]. Although the fraction of pesticide-vulnerable taxa was shown to be higher in the agricultural sections with FUS, vulnerable taxa were still considerably (up to 50 %) less frequent relative to least impacted stream sections in the studies [@knillmann_indication_2018; @liess_analyzing_2005; @schafer_thresholds_2012]. On the one hand, environmental selection through pesticide exposure may moderate the forming of the community assembly. On the other hand, a monotonous landscape structure might decrease the dispersal range. As a result, pesticide effects on the macroinvertebrate community can be only partly compensated.

Landscapes in Western Europe have been subject to agricultural intensification for decades, leading to the removal of non-agricultural structures, such as woodland and hedgerows, and the loss of low-intensity farmland [@donald_common_2002]. As the landscape shapes become more regular through the removal of non-agricultural structures, the geometric complexity of patches in the landscape -hereafter referred to as landscape heterogeneity- decrease [@moser_landscape_2002]. Consequently, dispersal and associated mass effects or rescue effects may be weakened, given small and fragmented recolonization patches [@leibold_metacommunity_2004]. In contrast, traditional farming practices have persisted in parts of Eastern Europe, such as Transylvania, Romania, with higher landscape heterogeneity than in corresponding Western European landscapes [@palang_forgotten_2006]. In Transylvania, the landscape is characterized by small patches of arable land (15 %), extensively used semi-natural meadows and pastures (40 %), forests (30 %), and hardly developed urban infrastructure (15 %) [@stoate_ecological_2009; @fischer_conservation_2012]. This landscape structure has been associated with a high diversity in butterflies and pollinators [@schmitt_changes_2007; @kovacs-hostyanszki_conservation_2016], and several amphibians that have declined in Western Europe are still common [@hartel_amphibian_2010]. Moreover, the sales of agrochemicals have been lower than in other parts of Europe [@stoate_ecological_2009; @fischer_conservation_2012; @eurostat_eurostat_2021]. This raises the question, how the landscape recolonization patches and landscape heterogeneity both fostering dispersal, and agricultural stressors such as pesticides as an instance of environmental selection interact in the shaping of the macroinvertebrate community. Although studies on the pollution of streams with current agrochemicals in the study region are mostly absent, we found pesticide exposure levels similar to areas of intensive agriculture in Western Europe in a companion study [@schreiner_paradise_2021]. Nevertheless, dispersal driven mass and rescue effects could alleviate or even mask environmental selection of macroinvertebrates and impacts on ecosystem functions by pesticides.

We conducted a field study on 19 agricultural streams in rural Transylvania, Romania, to assess the role of landscape heterogeneity and pesticide exposure in shaping the macroinvertebrate community. We sampled macroinvertebrate communities and measured the parasite (Microsporidia, Trematoda, Nematoda) prevalence in individuals of *Gammarus balcanicus* (Crustacea: Amphipoda) and *Baetis* sp. (Insecta: Ephemeroptera) and quantified the rate of LLD, to also explore potential responses of parasite prevalence and ecosystem functioning. Moreover, we analyzed the landscape composition including the presence of FUS, determined the landscape heterogeneity, and measured a range of water quality variables including pesticide toxicity towards invertebrates to establish associations between the aforementioned ecological responses and these variables.

# Materials and Methods

## Study area and sampling site selection
The study was conducted in a rural area in Transylvania, north-west Romania. The landscape is characterized by undulating terrain with hills reaching several hundred meters of height [@fischer_conservation_2012]. At 19 small wadeable, perennial lowland streams (3^rd^ to 4^th^ Strahler order, [@strahler_quantitative_1957]) a 100 m stream section was selected for macroinvertebrate and pesticide sampling (Figure 1). All sampling sites were characterized by arable land at least on one side of the stream. No large urban settlements, industrial sites, municipal or industrial wastewater treatment plants were located in the catchments upstream of the sampling sites. This suggests that non-agricultural stressors should have a minor influence on the outcome of the present study.

## Spatial analysis of catchments and land use types
The upstream catchments for the sampling sites and the stream network were derived from the European digital elevation model with a cell size of 25 m x 25 m [@eea_elevation_2004] using the free open-source software R, version 4.0.5, [@r_core_team_r_2021] and the R-package openSTARS [@kattwinkel_openstars_2020]. The fraction of land use types in each catchment was calculated by intersecting the derived catchments with the Corine Land Cover data [@clc_clc_2018; @lemm_identification_2017]. The land use types were aggregated into three groups, 1) arable land (representing arable land and permanent crops), 2) pastures also including heterogeneous agricultural areas, and 3) forest. The remaining land use in the catchments included urban settlements, natural shrubland, and unambiguous land use (for details on the CLC land use classes see Table_S 1) and was not included in the following analyses. The landscape heterogeneity was determined by calculating the landscape shape index from the R-package landscapemetrics, based on the landscape patches representing land use types [@hesselbarth_landscapemetrics_2019]. The metric represents the ratio of the actual edge length of all patches in a landscape and the hypothetical minimum edge length if only one patch was present. The minimum value for the metric is 1 and it increases without limit as the length of the edges in a landscape increases. To identify potential recolonization patches, we checked the catchments for the presence of forested stream sections upstream of the sampling sites using satellite images [@google_google_2021] and CLC data [@clc_clc_2018]. Sections were classified as forested upstream sections (FUS) if they stretched at least 500 m along the stream, within a 10 km distance from the sampling site and the forest covered at least a stretch of 100 m to both sides of the stream [@orlinskiy_forested_2015].

## Characterization of water quality and habitat conditions
<span style="color:red">The following parameters were repeatedly (9 to 10 times) measured during the study between end of April and end of June, the time of major pesticide application in the study area: water temperature, oxygen concentration, pH and electrical conductivity (EC) using a HI98194 multi-parameter device (HANNA instruments), as well as flow velocity using a flowmeter (Höntzsch). Water concentrations of nitrate (NO~3~^-^), nitrite (NH~2~^-^), ammonium (NH~4~^-^), ortho-phosphate (PO~4~^3-^) and chloride (Cl^-^) were measured photometrically in the field from unfiltered watersamples at the time of macroinvertebrate sampling in June using a Nanocolor PF-12 (Macherey-Nagel).</span>
Habitat parameters and variables like riparian vegetation type and height, width of buffer strips, shading provided by the riparian vegetation, average stream width and depth were recorded in June (Table_S 2). For the physico-chemical variables (<span style="color:red">oxygen concentration</span>, pH, EC) only values from the time point of the macroinvertebrate sampling were considered for the analyses. During the macroinvertebrate sampling, the sampled stream substrate type and grain size were also recorded. Fine sediments have been associated with changes in the macroinvertebrate community composition, commonly resulting in reduced richness and diversity of vulnerable taxa, such as EPT taxa [@jones_impact_2012; @wagenhoff_macroinvertebrate_2012]. Thus, the proportion of sediment with a grain size $\leq$ 2 mm of the stream substrate at the sampling sites was calculated.

## Macroinvertebrate sampling, identification and community metrics
Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled via standardized kick-sampling in late June 2016. At each site (defined as an approximately 100 m stream section) four samples were taken with a Surber sampler (sampling area: 900 cm^2^, 0.25 mm mesh size). Positions for the samples reflected the proportional share of the site-specific substrate types. Macroinvertebrates were separated from sediment and debris in the laboratory and directly conserved in ethanol until identification. <span style="color:red">Identification was done to the lowest feasible taxonomic level, as follows: species for EPT and Odonata; genus for Coleoptera; family for Diptera; class for Oligochaeta [@zwick_key_2004; @waringer_atlas_2011; @kriska_freshwater_2013; @tachet_invertebres_2000; @sansoni_atlante_2001; @dobson_guide_2012; @karaman_freshwater_1987; @copilas-ciocianu_zoogeography_2014; @nilsson_aquatic_2005; @bauernfeind_mayflies_2012; @heidemann_libellenlarven_2002; @gloer_susswassermollusken_2017].</span> Based on these data, various biological metrics, such as the proportion of EPT (Insecta: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) taxa (% EPT taxa, [@lenat_water_1988]), the proportion of EPT individuals (% EPT individuals, [@klemm_development_2003]), and Shannon Wiener taxa diversity (SWD, [@shannon_mathematical_1948]), which respond to a wide range of environmental stressors [@wilhm_comparison_1967; @stepenuck_impacts_2002] were computed (Table_S 3). Additionally, the SPEAR~pesticides~ metric (macroinvertebrate taxa classification based on Indicate-version 2019.10 [@indicate_indicate_2021]) was calculated [@liess_analyzing_2005; @knillmann_indication_2018].

## Shredder community
Macroinvertebrates associated with LLD belong to the feeding guild of shredders. Feeding traits based on the freshwaterecology.info database were used to identify shredder taxa [@schmidt-kloiber_wwwfreshwaterecologyinfo_2015]. <span style="color:red">Twenty shredder taxa were identified based on species or genus level. Four additional shredder taxa belonged to the families Limnephilidae, Limoniidae, Physidae and Tipulidae, which could not be identified to lower taxonomic levels.</span> Shredder communities were dominated by *G. balcanicus* in 58 % of the sampling sites (eleven out of 19) and it was the only gammarid species identified (Figure_S 1). Previously, the density of macroinvertebrate shredders in streams has been associated with higher LLD rates [@graca_role_2001; @schafer_thresholds_2012]. Therefore, the abundance of *G. balcanicus* and the abundance of non-gammarid shredders were calculated and used as explanatory variables for the LLD rate (see below). Moreover, repeated insecticide exposure of the Crustacean *Daphnia magna* has been linked to changes in the population size structure over several generations [@liess_intraspecific_2010; @liess_long-term_2006]. To assess if such a change is measurable in *G. balcanicus*, the average body weight was calculated based on all individuals (if n < 200), or a subset of approximately 150 gammarid individuals (if n $\ge$ 200) per site.

## Leaf litter decomposition
*Alnus glutinosa* (L.) Gaertn. (black alder) is common in the riparian zone of temperate Europe [@hewitt_post-glacial_1999] as well as in the study area and was used as model species to determine LLD. For logistic reasons, leaf material from Germany was used. Leaves were collected directly from branches shortly before defoliation in October 2015 at a site close to Landau, Germany (49.201944 °N, 8.143611 °E) and stored at -20 °C until further use. Leaves were dried at 60 °C and 2 $\pm$ 0.02 g of leaves were placed in fine and coarse mesh bags (0.5 mm and 10 mm mesh size). The fine mesh leaf bags prevented macroinvertebrates from feeding on the leaf material and were used to assess microbial LLD. Macroinvertebrate LLD was measured with coarse mesh leaf bags, with the mass loss being corrected for microbial LLD. Triplicates of fine and coarse mesh leaf bags were deployed at each sampling site end of May for 27 to 29 days. Upon retrieval, the mesh bags were gently rinsed to remove macroinvertebrates and sediment, placed on ice and transported to the laboratory, where they were stored at -20 °C until further analysis. The remaining leaf litter was freeze-dried and weighed to the nearest 0.01 mg. The macroinvertebrate LLD rate $k_{macro_i}$ for each sampling site *i* was calculated as [@benfield_decomposition_2007]:
$$
k_{macro_i} = \frac{-ln(\frac{S_i(t)}{S_i(0)})}{t*\bar{T}}
$$
where *S* is the leaf mass as a function of deployment time *t* in days and average water temperature  measured at six time points during deployment. *S~i~(0)* is the leaf mass determined at the start of the experiment, and *S~i~(t)* is the remaining leaf litter corrected for the mass loss in fine mesh bags at site *i*.

## Parasite analysis
To assess the effects of stressors associated with agricultural land use on parasite-presence in host species, ten individuals of each *G. balcanicus* and *Baetis* sp. were sampled in June from twelve and 14 sampling sites, respectively, and checked for parasite infection with Microsporidia, Nematoda and Trematoda. DNA was extracted from whole organisms using a salt precipitation protocol as described in @grabner_invaders_2015. PCR was conducted using universal primers for the respective parasite group (Microsporidia: V1 (5’-CAC CAG GTT GAT TCT GCC TGA C-3’)/Mic-uni3R (5’-ATT ACC GCG GMT GCT GGC AC-3’), Trematoda: Trem1F (5’-TGA CCT YGG ATC AGW CGT GA-3’)/ Trem1R (5’-ACC YAA ACA CCA CAT TGC CTA-3’), NemuniF (5’-GAC GAG CGC ATC TAT TAG A-3’)/ NemuniR (5’-TGG YAT CGT TTA CRG TYA G-3’), see @grabner_hidden_2017 for details). The prevalence values of the three systematic groups of parasites for *G. balcanicus* and *Baetis* sp. were calculated.

##	<span style="color:red">Pesticide sampling and calculation of toxic units as a proxy of pesticide toxicity</span>
Pesticide sampling and analysis are detailed in @schreiner_paradise_2021. <span style="color:red">Briefly, two types of passive samplers were used to capture hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. Empore styrene divinylbenzene reverse phase sulfonate (SDB) disks (3M, Germany) were used for hydrophilic compounds [@vrana_calibration_2006]. The sampling focused on surface run-off from agricultural areas into streams, which represents a dominant exposure pathway [@stehle_probabilistic_2013; @kreuger_pesticides_1998]. Three precipitation events and one additional sampling period representing pesticide concentrations at base flow (mid-May) were captured [@schreiner_paradise_2021]. Shortly before a forecasted rain event, duplicate SDB disks were deployed per sampling site. They were retrieved after five to six days and stored at -20 °C in 6 mL of acetone (LC-grade) until chemical extraction.</span>
<span style="color:red">Polydimethylsiloxane sheets (PDMS, AlteSil, 0.5 mm thickness Altec) were used or sampling hydrophobic pesticides such as pyrethroid and organophosphate insecticides. The sheets (measuring 12.5 cm x 10 cm) were fixed to aluminum posts and deployed in the streams twice for four weeks each. This longer sampling period was chosen because hydrophobic pesticides typically occur at low environmental concentrations, requiring longer deployment times to accumulate sufficient mass for analysis in the passive samplers [@moschet_picogram_2014]. At retrieval, the PDMS sheets were gently cleaned from sediments and biofilm, rolled up and stored in glass vials at -20 °C until chemical extraction. SDB disks were analyzed for 178 pesticides via LC-MS/MS and PDMS sheets were analyzed for 17 pesticides via GC-MS/MS. Chemical analysis and the estimation of water concentrations are explained in detail in @schreiner_paradise_2021.</span>
The potential cumulative pesticide toxicity within a sample was estimated as the logarithmic sum of toxic units (sumTU):
$$
sumTU = log(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\frac{c_{est_i}}{EC_{50_i}})
$$
where $c_{est_i}$ is the estimated water concentration of pesticide *i* and $EC_{50_i}$ is the concentration of pesticide *i* at which 50 % of test organisms display an effect (immobility or mortality) in 48-h to 96-h single-species laboratory tests. For each site, the *n* compounds that were found in the passive samplers were considered. As test organisms, the most sensitive freshwater invertebrate (sumTU~invertebrates~) for which test data were available for a given pesticide was selected, because previous studies suggested that this metric is closely associated with community metrics for macroinvertebrates [@schafer_how_2013; @brock_acute_2012]. Data of single-species laboratory tests was compiled from @malaj_organic_2014, @lewis_international_2016 and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ECOTOXicology Knowledgebase [@epa_ecotoxicology_2018] and checked for plausibility (water solubility, outliers). The maximum sumTU~invertebrates~ of the four sampling events for each respective sampling site was used, assuming that environmental selection through the strongest stress event shapes the macroinvertebrate community [@fernandez_effects_2015].

## Data analysis
To identify environmental variables and parameters that explain variability in different ecological responses (proportion of EPT taxa and individuals, SWD, SPEAR~pesticides~, *k~macro~*, average body weight and log~10~(x + 1)-transformed abundance of *G. balcanicus*, and log~10~(x + 1)-transformed abundance of non-gammarid shredders) regression analysis was used. The number of environmental variables and parameters exceeded the sample size. To avoid over-fitting of the models, a subset of environmental variables and parameters were selected as predictors. Environmental variables and parameters that exhibited a very low variability, because most values were similar and the range of values was unlikely to be ecologically relevant, were excluded from the following analyses. Among variables that exhibited high collinearity (Pearson correlation > 0.7) and variance inflation factors above 10 [@lin_solving_2008], a subset of non-collinear variables was selected based on expert judgment. The environmental variables and parameters used for statistical analysis are listed in Table 1, and constitute drivers at both the catchment and local scale.

Given the low ratio of observations to predictors, an elastic net regression approach [@zou_regularization_2005] was chosen using the glmnet package [@friedman_regularization_2010]. For all models, a Gaussian distribution of the response variable with an identity link function was assumed. The caret package [@kuhn_caret_2020] was used for parameter estimation of $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ with Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV), where $\alpha$ sets the degree of mixing between ridge regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression (ridge regression: $\alpha$ = 0, LASSO regression: $\alpha$ = 1). $\lambda$ adds a constraint to the regression coefficients, shrinking them towards zero with increasing values for $\lambda$. Environmental variables and parameters were standardized prior to the analysis because they vary in their range and magnitude and the constraint added to the regression coefficients depends on the magnitude of each variable.

Furthermore, the community and environmental data were analyzed using multivariate Redundancy Analysis (RDA) [@oksanen_vegan_2020] to identify environmental variables and parameters (same predictors as in regression models) that are associated with variability in community composition. Prior to the analysis, the macroinvertebrate data was aggregated on family level to achieve a consistent taxonomic resolution. Taxa that occurred at just one sampling site were excluded from the analysis to decrease statistical noise. RDA model building was based on stepwise variable selection in both directions (backward and forward), including environmental variables and parameters with p-values < 0.1 in the final model. The final model was tested for significance using analysis of variance.

The range of microsporidian prevalence in *G. balcanicus* and of Nematoda and Trematoda in *Baetis* sp. was very small. Therefore, we calculated the average prevalence of the three parasites to screen for associations with environmental variables and parameters. Given the low number of sites (12 and 14 for *G. balcanicus* and *Baetis* sp., respectively), single Pearson’s correlations with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing were calculated using the variables identified as relevant in the RDA (proportion of arable land, proportion of pastures and in addition maximum sumTU~invertebrates~, given the scope of our study). All data preparation, calculation, and visualizations were done with the statistical open-source software R, version 4.0.5, [@r_core_team_r_2021] combined with packages including ggplot2 for graphical presentations [@wickham_ggplot2_2016], and taxize [@chamberlain_taxize_2013] for retrieval of taxonomic information.

# Results

## Landuse structure in the catchments
Summary statistics for variables of water and habitat quality as well as land use parameters are shown in Table 1. The size of upstream catchment areas ranged from 7.5 km^2^ to 177 km^2^ (mean = 73.9 km^2^). Arable land (range: 6.8 % to 61.4 %, mean = 26.1 %) was mostly located in plain areas along the main streams, whereas forests (range: 2.9 % to 50.7 %, mean = 25.2 %, Table_S 1) mainly surrounded the sources of the streams, which were the areas of greatest slopes and elevation (Figure 1) [@fischer_conservation_2012]. The fraction of pastures ranged from 3.9 % to 70.8 % of the catchment area (mean: 35 %). The landscape heterogeneity exhibited a close to normal distribution and ranged from 2.78 to 13.62 (mean = 7.79) slightly decreasing with increasing proportions of arable land (*r* = -0.33, p = 0.17). Ten out of 19 catchments had forested areas, which were classified as FUS.

##	Drivers of variability in macroinvertebrate metrics
65 macroinvertebrate taxa and a total number of 26,308 individuals were sampled. Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) and Oligochaeta were highly abundant at most sampling sites, whereas many other taxa were only occasionally found, typically at much lower abundances (Figure_S 2). The macroinvertebrate metric best explained in terms of R^2^ by the set of environmental variables and parameters was the indicator SPEAR~pesticides~ (R^2^ = 0.39, Table 2). <span style="color:red">Landscape heterogeneity, FUS and, albeit to a much lesser extent, flow velocity exhibited a positive association with the SPEAR~pesticides~ metric. The aquatic ortho-phosphate concentration was negatively associated with the metric.</span>  The mean SPEAR~pesticides~ values for sites with FUS (mean = 14.28 %, sd = 6.18) and without FUS (mean = 5.9 %, sd = 3.9) differed significantly (t = -3.57, p = 0.003, Figure 2). <span style="color:red">The proportion of EPT taxa as a measure of general degradation exhibited positive associations with the oxygen concentration, FUS, landscape heterogeneity and flow velocity. The proportion of pastures and aximum sumTU~invertebrates~ were also positively associated but to a lesser extent. EC, ortho-phosphate concentration, arable land and fine sediment were negatively associated with this metric (Table 2).</span> The elastic net model for diversity in terms of SWD contained the proportion of fine sediment exhibiting a negative association and the proportion of pastures showing a positive association (R^2^ = 0.19). The smallest R^2^ was obtained for the model with the proportion of EPT abundance as the response variable. Negative associations of a similar magnitude could be observed for the proportion of arable land and fine sediment. <span style="color:red">Additionally, EC and ortho-phosphate concentration exhibited negative associations with the metric, but to a lesser extent. The proportion of pastures, FUS and oxygen concentration were positively associated with this EPT metric (Table 2).</span>

##	Redundancy analysis of macroinvertebrate community
<span style="color:red">Stepwise model building for the macroinvertebrate community resulted in a model with two constrained axes, overall explaining 18.8 % of the variation.</span> The variables proportion of arable land and proportion of pastures were selected as predictors. Gastropoda showed the strongest positive association to the proportion of arable land, followed by Glossiphoniidae, Bivalvia, Tipulidae and Limnephilidae. Ceratopogonidae showed the strongest negative association to the proportion of arable land, closely followed by Leuctridae, Empididae, Ephemerellidae, Hydropsychidae and Heptageniidae. Baetidae exhibited the strongest positive association to the proportion of pastures and was also strongly associated with the proportion of arable land. The Diptera families Dixidae, Simuliidae and Limoniidae as well as the Coleoptera family Hydraenidae were also strongly positively associated with the proportion of pastures and arable land. Hydropsychidae showed a strong positive association with the proportion of pastures, but a negative association with the proportion of arable land. Limnephilidae, Sialidae, Gastropoda, Gammaridae and Corduliidae were the taxa with the strongest negative association with the proportion of pastures (Figure 3). 

##	Shredder community and leaf litter decomposition (*k~macro~*)
No environmental drivers were selected by the elastic net model for the average body weight of *G. balcanicus*, abundance of non-gammarid shredders and *k~macro~*. <span style="color:red">*G. balcanicus* was the only gammarid species and its abundance outweighed the summed abundance of all other shredder individuals at 58 % of sampling sites (eleven out of 19).</span> The abundance of *G. balcanicus* was positively associated with flow velocity, EC, proportion of arable land and maximum sumTU~invertebrates~. <span style="color:red">FUS, oxygen concentration</span> and ortho-phosphate concentration exhibited a negative association (see Table 2).</span>

##	Parasites in *G. balcanicus* and *Baetis* sp.
*G. balcanicus* infected with Microsporidia were found at all twelve sampling sites (mean prevalence: 94.2 %), Nematoda and Trematoda exhibited a mean prevalence of 15.0 % and 16.7 %, respectively (Figure 4). Parasite prevalence was lower in *Baetis* sp. compared to *G. balcanicus*, with mean prevalence values of 32.1 %, 1.4 %, and 7.9 % for Microsporidia, Nematoda, and Trematoda respectively (Figure 4). Moderate and weak, but statistically non-significant associations of the average parasite prevalence in *G. balcanicus* and *Baetis* sp. with the proportion of arable land (*r* = -0.47 and 0.07), proportion of pastures (*r* = 0.5 and 0.1) and maximum sumTU~invertebrates~ (*r* = -0.16 and -0.08) were found (Bonferroni-corrected p-values for *G. balcanicus* = 0.36, 0.3, 1; for *Baetis* sp. all p = 1).

#	Discussion
##	Pesticides as a potential driver for the degradation of macroinvertebrate communities
The macroinvertebrate communities of this study comprised only few vulnerable taxa, reflected by the small values for SPEAR~pesticides~ (Figure_S 2 and Table_S 3), which are similar to the results of a study on multiple stressor effects in Danish headwater streams [@rasmussen_catchment_2013]. The higher SPEAR~pesticides~ values reported by @schafer_thresholds_2012 at similar pesticide exposure levels may partly be explained by changes in the vulnerability classification of the indicator taxa [@knillmann_indication_2018]. <span style="color:red">To reduce the influence of refuge areas on the SPEAR~pesticides~ metric, taxa that are highly abundant at refuge areas and occur in sites with high levels of pesticide toxicity have been classified as refuge taxa and as "not at risk", thereby reducing the number taxa at risk.</span>
Pesticide toxicity in the form of maximum sumTU~invertebrates~ exceeded effect thresholds for macroinvertebrate communities and aquatic insects reported in previous studies by at least one order of magnitude at all sites [@schafer_thresholds_2012; @wijngaarden_threshold_2005] and may have acted as an environmental filter for the macroinvertebrate communities. 
However, maximum sumTU~invertebrates~ was selected for only one macroinvertebrate metric and the association was weak but positive (Table 2). <span style="color:red">These observations contrast with results of several previous studies from Western Europe, where SPEAR~pesticides~ as well as general macroinvertebrate metrics indicating degradation (e.g. proportion of EPT) were strongly negatively associated with pesticide toxicity [@beketov_spear_2009; @knillmann_indication_2018; @liess_pesticides_2021; @liess_analyzing_2005; @orlinskiy_forested_2015].</span> The estimated pesticide toxicity in terms of toxic units (TU) in these studies spanned up to four orders of magnitude and the studies included sites with toxicity levels below suggested effect thresholds [@schafer_thresholds_2012; @wijngaarden_threshold_2005]. In our study, the pesticide exposure levels equaled those of the most highly polluted sites of a meta-analysis [@schafer_thresholds_2012], while the gradient of pesticide toxicity in our study was substantially shorter (1.5 orders of magnitude). These two conditions (short pesticide gradient and generally high exposure) may explain the absence of an association of pesticide toxicity with macroinvertebrate metrics, but these results should not be interpreted as evidence of pesticides being a negligible driver. Indeed, the values of the SPEAR~pesticides~ indicator (Table_S 3) suggested a strong degradation of the communities in almost all sampling sites. Although, further stressors associated with agriculture potentially play an important role for the macroinvertebrate community composition (see 4.3), pesticide toxicity was pervasive and based on the low SPEAR~pesticides~ values we conclude that environmental selection through pesticide exposure played a similarly important role as in highly polluted sites of studies from Western Europe.

##	The role of landscape variables for the recolonization processes of macroinvertebrate communities
Landscape characteristics in the form of pastures, arable land, FUS and landscape heterogeneity were selected as explanatory variables in the regression analysis and, except for FUS and landscape heterogeneity, in the RDA. Extensively used landscapes, such as pastures and FUS, were positively associated with three of the four macroinvertebrate metrics (pastures: both EPT metrics and SWD; FUS: both EPT metrics and SPEAR~pesticides~, Table 2). Indeed, for SPEAR~pesticides~ the regression analysis included landscape heterogeneity and FUS as the most important predictor variables, indicating a relevant influence of FUS and landscape heterogeneity on the pesticide-related effects on the macroinvertebrate community. The mean SPEAR~pesticides~ value of sampling sites with FUS was almost three times higher compared to sites without FUS, though the values remained at a fairly low level (Figure 2). The observation matches the effect size from studies in other parts of Europe  [@liess_analyzing_2005; @knillmann_indication_2018; @orlinskiy_forested_2015]. Based on this result, we conclude a similar effect of dispersal, resulting in the observed recolonization at sites with FUS despite a different landscape structure in our study region. However, in a study in an intensively used agricultural region in Central Germany [@liess_analyzing_2005], FUS were associated with an increase in the proportion of pesticide-vulnerable taxa (measured using SPEAR~pesticides~) only several months after the pesticide application. In contrast, in our study this effect of FUS was visible already during the pesticide application period. Unlike in Western Europe, weirs and low head dams, which have been shown to greatly reduce downstream drift of several macroinvertebrates [@brooks_barriers_2018], are largely absent from the study area, potentially enhancing dispersal through drift compared to Western Europe [@belletti_more_2020]. In addition, aerial dispersal in the study region likely benefits from fairly open landscapes (pastures and arable land) with mainly small urban areas and intact riparian vegetation [@sondermann_modelling_2015]. Indeed, landscape heterogeneity exhibited the strongest positive association with the SPEAR~pesticides~ metric (Table 2), indicating that heterogeneous landscapes enhance habitat connectivity and thereby potentially dispersal and recolonization [@streib_how_2020]. The dominant importance of landscape variables in our study is further backed up by the RDA results (Figure 3), where the proportion of arable land and pastures were chosen as the only relevant predictor variables for the macroinvertebrate community composition. To sum up, in comparison to Western European regions, dispersal from FUS as recolonization patches leads to a similar increase in pesticide-vulnerable taxa, but the recolonization dynamics appear to be faster, where downstream drift and landscape heterogeneity may play a larger role. Nevertheless, pesticide-vulnerable taxa remain scarce also at sampling sites with FUS, as indicated by low values for SPEAR~pesticides~.

##	Water quality affects macroinvertebrate metrics indicating general degradation
The water quality variables included in our analyses exhibited associations with the four macroinvertebrate metrics to various extents. For the metrics SPEAR~pesticides~ and proportion of EPT abundance these associations were mostly much weaker than the landscape variables (except for the proportion of fine sediment for the EPT abundance, Table 2). <span style="color:red">For the proportion of EPT taxa, however, water quality variables such as oxygen concentration, EC and ortho-phosphate concentration exhibited a strong association with the metric, or were at least in a similar range as the landscape variables.</span> This may reflect EPT metrics being indicators of general degradation. <span style="color:red">Agriculture has been identified as a driver for many of the water quality variables, such as fine sediment and nutrient (such as ortho-phosphate) inputs, increase in EC, decreasing oxygen concentration and changes in flow velocity through channelization and weirs [@stoate_ecological_2009; @allan_landscapes_2004].</span> Fine sediment was negatively associated with diversity in terms of SWD and both EPT metrics and was among the most relevant predictors for these three metrics. This matches our knowledge on the response of macroinvertebrate communities to sedimentation. Related community changes have been reported in field and mesocosm studies [@wagenhoff_macroinvertebrate_2012; @govenor_macroinvertebrate_2019; @vos_taxonomic_2017] and various effect mechanisms have been described [@jones_impact_2012]. <span style="color:red">However, without further distinction of finer sediment fractions (such as silt, clay, or mud), the specific mechanisms of the association between fine sediment and the response variables withstands further explanation. EC and oxygen concentration were associated with both EPT metrics as expected from previous studies that showed a generally positive response to oxygen concentration and the opposite to EC [@lewin_biological_2013; @wright_impact_2016; @schafer_trait_2011].</span> The positive, albeit rather low, association of pesticide toxicity in terms of maximum sumTU~invertebrates~ with the proportion of EPT taxa, however, is unexpected and contradicts results of previous studies, where pesticide toxicity was strongly negatively associated with EPT metrics [@knillmann_indication_2018; @liess_pesticides_2021]. Such unexpected associations as described may indicate complex interactions. For example, the low positive association of pesticide toxicity with the proportion of EPT taxa may result from the positive correlation of landscape heterogeneity with maximum sumTU~invertebrates~ (*r* = 0.63, p = 0.004). Landscape heterogeneity might facilitate dispersal, compensating the effects of increasing pesticide toxicity in our study. Furthermore, the ratio of observations to predictors was small, which means that some associations may not be stable and should be treated with caution. The association of the diversity metric SWD with only two of the selected environmental variables and parameters and its small R^2^ value suggests that this metric is unsuitable to indicate anthropogenic stress, as also reported in a recent study on pesticide stress in German lowland streams [@liess_pesticides_2021].

##	No response of most functional community metrics and leaf litter decomposition (*k~macro~*) to environmental drivers
Except for the abundance of *G. balcanicus*, none of the functional community metrics nor *k~macro~* were associated with the environmental variables and parameters. *G. balcanicus* dominated the shredder communities in 58 % of sampling sites (eleven out of 19) in our study region. Furthermore, several stressor variables (proportion of arable land and sediment, EC) with negative associations to the EPT metrics were either not or positively associated with the *Gammarus* metric. Consequently, the amphipod belonged to the rather tolerant taxa of our study. <span style="color:red">*G. balcanicus* abundance exhibited the strongest associations with flow velocity, FUS and oxygen concentration.</span> The measured flow velocities in this study were low to moderate, possibly explaining the positive association of *G. balcanicus* with this parameter. A moderate water current prevents sedimentation of fine particles, which might cover coarse substrate preferred by many gammarid species [@paganelli_spatial_2020; @kley_influence_2009]. However, this explanation is not supported by the missing association of *G. balcanicus* abundance with the proportion of fine sediment in our study. <span style="color:red">Shredder taxa have been shown to exhibit a positive relationship to fine sediment deposition, which may be related to the deposition of organic material as food source</span> [@rabeni_stream_2005]. *G. balcanicus* abundance showed a negative association with FUS. A study on the adaptation of *G. pulex* to insecticides found a lower tolerance in sites with FUS and argued that migration processes between pesticide-polluted sites and non-polluted FUS patches hinder adaptation in terms of developing tolerance [@shahid_adaptation_2018]. This might explain a stronger environmental selection in polluted sites and the negative association with FUS. Another explanation may be increased competition with other taxa in sites with FUS, which coincides with the positive association of *Gammarus* abundance with pesticide toxicity in terms of maximum sumTU~invertebrates~. <span style="color:red">Similar to the results of a study in agricultural streams of Denmark, we did not find any associations of the LLD rate *k~macro~* with the selected environmental variables and parameters [@rasmussen_catchment_2013].</span> This was explained by the significant correlation of *Gammarus* abundance and the LLD rate, however, no such relationship could be observed in our study. Furthermore, and in contrast to the results of a previous study, *k~macro~* showed no significant correlation to the SPEAR~pesticides~ indicator (*r* = -0.21, p = 0.41) [@schafer_thresholds_2012]. Our results indicate that the ecosystem function LLD in terms of *k~macro~* was rather tolerant of the stressors in the study region. <span style="color:red">However, at least for maximum sumTU~invertebrates~, the small gradient may hamper the detection of effects and thus the LLD results should be interpreted with caution.</span>

##	Parasite infection of *G. balcanicus* and *Baetis* sp.
*G. balcanicus* and *Baetis* sp. were analyzed for infections with Microsporidia, Nematoda and Trematoda. The prevalence of *G. balcanicus* infected with Microsporidia was very high at all sampling sites (mean = 94.2 %). These prevalence values are at the higher end of values reported in previous studies, which ranged between 27 % to 95 % [@grabner_effect_2014; @grabner_hidden_2017; @grabner_invaders_2015; @hatcher_local_2005; @mautner_evidence_2007; @ryan_virulence_2010]. The mean prevalence of trematode and nematode parasites was lower (15 % and 16.7 % respectively) and comparable to prevalence values in *G. lacustris* [@shaw_high_2020], whereas @grabner_hidden_2017 found a prevalence of 70 % for trematodes in two amphipod species. To our knowledge, data on the prevalence of the target parasite groups in *Baetis* sp. is lacking in the literature. Therefore, we provide the first data for these parasites in this genus. None of the environmental variables and parameters were selected in the correlation analysis to explain the parasite prevalence and sumTU~invertebrates~ showed no effect on parasite prevalence in hosts. As mentioned earlier, this might be a result of the pesticide exposure pattern in our study (short gradient with high levels of toxicity). Microsporidia as the most abundant parasites in our study, are monoxenous parasites (single host life cycle) and produce durable spores or utilize vertical transmission [@smith_ecology_2009]. This reduces the impact of environmental factors on the parasite itself and leads to an infection if the host occurs [@sures_parasite_2017]. Notably, the observed female-biased sex ratio of *G. balcanicus* at all sampling sites might be related to feminizing Microsporidia (Table_S 4). A number of microsporidian species in amphipods turn males into functional females to enhance their vertical transmission [@terry_widespread_2004; @mautner_evidence_2007]. For the parasites with complex life cycles that include delicate free-living stages (e.g. trematodes), the number of tested host individuals was likely too low to detect differences between sites given the low prevalence.

#	Conclusion
Freshwater ecosystems are affected by various agriculture-related stressors and pesticide pollution has previously been identified as one of the major contributors to the loss of vulnerable macroinvertebrate taxa. A heterogeneous landscape with patches of low intensity land use is beneficial to dispersal-driven mass and rescue effects originating from recolonization patches in forested upstream sections of streams. Pesticide-vulnerable taxa were scarce at all sampling sites of our study, but most macroinvertebrate metrics were positively associated with recolonization patches and landscape heterogeneity, resulting in higher proportions of sensitive taxa at respective sites. Functional responses (*Gammarus* abundance and macroinvertebrate LLD) did not show a clear relationship with landscape parameters, though *G. balcanicus* was positively associated with several stressor variables and thus appears to be rather tolerant towards agriculture-related stressors. Our study suggests that through dispersal, mass and rescue effects benefit from a heterogeneous landscape, even though stressor effects remain convoluted and a clear association of macroinvertebrate responses with pesticide toxicity was missing. Consequently, landscape management that promotes and reestablishes landscape structures of low intensive land use may benefit macroinvertebrates and other animals through increasing suitable habitat patches and meta-population persistence.

# Text_S 1 Pesticide sampling and analysis
<span style="color:blue">Two types of passive samplers were used to capture hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. Empore styrene divinylbenzene reverse phase sulfonate (SDB) disks (3M, Germany) were used for hydrophilic compounds [@vrana_calibration_2006]. The sampling focused on surface run-off from agricultural areas into streams, which represents a dominant exposure pathway [@stehle_probabilistic_2013; @kreuger_pesticides_1998]. Three precipitation events and one additional sampling period representing pesticide concentrations at base flow (mid-May) were captured [@schreiner_paradise_2021]. Shortly before a forecasted rain event, duplicate SDB disks were deployed per sampling site. They were retrieved after five to six days and stored at -20 °C in 6 mL of acetone (LC-grade) until chemical extraction.
Polydimethylsiloxane sheets (PDMS, AlteSil, 0.5 mm thickness Altec) were used or sampling hydrophobic pesticides such as pyrethroid and organophosphate insecticides. The sheets (measuring 12.5 cm x 10 cm) were fixed to aluminum posts and deployed in the streams twice for four weeks each. This longer sampling period was chosen because hydrophobic pesticides typically occur at low environmental concentrations, requiring longer deployment times to accumulate sufficient mass for analysis in the passive samplers [@moschet_picogram_2014]. At retrieval, the PDMS sheets were gently cleaned from sediments and biofilm, rolled up and stored in glass vials at -20 °C until chemical extraction. SDB disks were analyzed for 178 pesticides via LC-MS/MS and PDMS sheets were analyzed for 17 pesticides via GC-MS/MS. Water concentrations were estimated as explained in detail in @schreiner_paradise_2021.</span>
