	abstract = {Abstract Leaves entering low order streams are subject to physical abrasion, microbial degradation and invertebrate fragmentation. Aquatic invertebrates feeding on leaves are known as shredders and their densities tend to be correlated with the spatial and temporal accumulation of organic matter in streams. Shredders discriminate among the variety of leaves normally found in the stream; this discrimination may be related to differences in leaf toughness, plant nutrient content of leaves and the presence of secondary compounds. Shredders also consume leaves preferentially after the establishment of a well-developed microbial community. This preference may be the result of changes in leaf matrix carried out by the microbial community or the presence of fungal hyphae with a higher nutrition value than the leaves themselves. The immediate consequence of invertebrate feeding on leaves is the incorporation of plant material into secondary production and the fragmentation of leaves. The relative importance of fungi and invertebrates in the decomposition process depends upon the density of shredders, which, in turn, may depend on litter accumulation in streams. Therefore, the type of riparian vegetation has the potential to control the diversity and abundance of shredders and changes in riparian vegetation have the potential to affect the assemblages of aquatic invertebrates.},

	abstract = {From headwaters to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a continuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream communities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjustments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a framework for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implications of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are discussed.Key words: river continuum; stream ecosystems; ecosystem structure, function; resource partitioning; ecosystem stability; community succession; river zonation; stream geomorphology},

	abstract = {Subsidies from adjacent ecosystems can alter recipient food webs and ecosystem functions, such as herbivory. Emerging aquatic insects from streams can be an important prey in the riparian zone. Such aquatic subsidies can enhance predator abundances or cause predators to switch prey, depending on the herbivores. This can lead to an increase or decrease of
              in situ
              herbivores and herbivory. We examined the effects of aquatic subsidies on a simplified terrestrial food web consisting of two types of herbivores, plants and predators (spiders). In our six-week experiment, we focused on the prey choice of the spiders by excluding predator immigration and reproduction. In accordance with predator switching, survival of leafhoppers increased in the presence of aquatic subsidies. By contrast, the presence of aquatic subsidies indirectly reduced weevils and herbivory. Our study shows that effects of aquatic subsidies on terrestrial predators can propagate through the food web in contrasting ways. Thereby, the outcome of the trophic cascade is determined by the prey choice of predators.},

	abstract = {Abstract EFSA's Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) was tasked to revise the Guidance Document (GD) on Aquatic Ecotoxicology under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (SANCO/3268/2001 rev.4 (final), 17 October 2002). This Guidance of the PPR Panel is the first of three requested deliverables within this mandate. It has its focus on tiered acute and chronic effect assessment schemes with detailed guidance on tier 1 and higher tier effect assessments for aquatic organisms in edge‐of‐field surface waters and on proposals regarding how to link effects to exposure estimates. The exposure assessment methodology was not reviewed and it is assumed that the current FOCUS surface water exposure assessment methodology will continue to be used for exposure assessment at EU level. The current GD is intended to be used for authorisation of active substances at EU level as well as for plant protection products at Member State level. The effect assessment schemes in this GD allow for the derivation of regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs) on the basis of two options: (1) the ecological threshold option (ETO), accepting negligible population effects only, and (2) the ecological recovery option (ERO), accepting some population‐level effects if ecological recovery takes place within an acceptable time period. In the tiered effect assessment schemes, in principle, all tiers (1, 2 and 3) are able to address the ETO, while the model ecosystem approach (tier 3), under certain conditions, is able to also address the ERO. The GD provides the scientific background for the risk assessment to aquatic organisms in edge‐of‐field surface waters and is structured to give detailed guidance on all assessment steps. An executive summary joining all parts of the guidance and decision schemes in a concise way is provided and is intended to help applicants and regulatory authorities in day‐to‐day use.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Macroinvertebrate densities and community composition were examined at three spatial scales after substratum disturbance; among reaches along a longitudinal gradient, within reaches and within plots. Reaches consisted of sandstone outcrops that were separated by approximately 2 km of highly mobile sandy silt substratum. 2. Substrata were disturbed by scraping sandstone plots (0.3 ± 0.3 m). Body-sized depressions created by Trichoptera in the sandstone were removed along with the upper 5 mm of sandstone, resulting in areas of newly exposed, smooth sandstone. 3. The spatial scale of examination determined whether patterns of macroinvertebrate distribution and densities were discernible. Initially there were no significant differences in community composition or total densities among reaches or among upstream/ downstream locations within reaches. Following substratum disturbance and 30 days recolonizarion, total macroinvertebrate densities did not differ significantly between undisturbed plots and disturbed plots. However, densities of Petrophilia (Pyralidae: Lepidoptera) differed along the longitudinal gradient and the Simuliidae had its highest density in the upstream reach. Significant differences were found in total macroinvertebrate densities between the upstream and the downstream halves of disturbed plots, with higher densities occurring in the downstream portions. 4. Recolonized plots had similar macroinvertebrate densities and community composition to undisturbed plots, suggesting that the stream community was highly resilient.},

For comparisons, samples should be collected in clean areas either above the outfall or at a sufficient distance downstream. A diversity index may be used to summarize data; such an index should be independent of sample size and associated closely with the wealth of species.

	abstract = {Amphipods are a key component of aquatic ecosystems due to their distribution, abundance and ecological role. They also serve as hosts for many micro- and macro-parasites. The importance of parasites and the necessity to include them in ecological studies has been increasingly recognized in the last two decades by ecologists and conservation biologists. Parasites are able to alter survival, growth, feeding, mobility, mating, fecundity and stressors’ response of their amphipod hosts. In addition to their modulating effects on host population size and dynamics, parasites affect community structure and food webs in different ways: by increasing the susceptibility of amphipods to predation, by quantitatively and qualitatively changing the host diet, and by modifying competitive interactions. Human-induced stressors such as climate change, pollution and species introduction that affect host–parasite equilibrium, may enhance or reduce the infection effects on hosts and ecosystems. The present review illustrates the importance of parasites for ecosystem processes using examples from aquatic environments and amphipods as a host group. As seen from the literature, amphipod–parasite systems are likely a key component of ecological processes, but more quantitative data from natural populations and field evidence are necessary to support the results obtained by experimental research.},

	abstract = {Amphipods are commonly parasitized by acanthocephalans and microsporidians and co-infections are found frequently. Both groups of parasites are known to have severe effects on their host. For example, microsporidians can modify host sex ratio and acanthocephalans can manipulate the behavior of the amphipod to promote transmission to the final host. These effects influence host metabolism in general and will also affect the ability of amphipods to cope with additional stressors such as environmental pollution, e.g., by toxic metals. Here we tested the effects of sub-lethal concentrations of cadmium on glycogen and lipid levels, as well as on the 70kDa heat shock protein (hsp70) response of field collected
              Gammarus fossarum
              , which were naturally infected with microsporidians and the acanthocephalan
              Polymorphus minutus
              . Infected and uninfected
              G. fossarum
              were exposed to a nominal Cd concentration of 4 µg/L, which resembled measured aqueous Cd concentration of 2.9 µg/L in reconstituted water for 7 d at 15 °C in parallel to an unexposed control. After exposure gammarids were snap frozen, weighed, sexed and tested for microsporidian infection by PCR. Only individuals containing the microsporidian
              Dictyocoela duebenum
              were used for the further biochemical and metal analyses.
              P. minutus
              infected amphipods were significantly smaller than their uninfected conspecifics. Mortality was insignificantly increased due to cadmium exposure, but not due to parasite infection. Microsporidian infection in combination with cadmium exposure led to increased glycogen levels in female gammarids. An increase of glycogen was also found due to interaction of acanthocephalan and microsporidian infection. Elevated lipid levels were observed in all groups infected with microsporidians, while acanthocephalans had the opposite effect. A positive correlation of lipid and glycogen levels was observed. The general stress response measured in form of hsp70 was significantly increased in microsporidian infected gammarids exposed to cadmium.
              P. minutus
              did not affect the stress response of its host. Lipid levels were correlated negatively with hsp70 response, and indicated a possible increased stress susceptibility of individuals with depleted energy reserves. The results of our study clearly demonstrate the importance of parasitic infections, especially of microsporidians, for ecotoxicological research.},

	abstract = {[Circumstantial evidence has suggested that marine microphallid trematodes using gastropods Hydrobia spp. as first intermediate hosts, amphipods Corophium spp. as second intermediate hosts, and various waterbirds as final hosts, may cause temperature-dependent epizootics and eventually local extinction of intermediate host populations. Therefore, we examined experimentally the impact of the microphallid trematode Maritrema subdolum on Corophium volutator with special reference to the influence of temperature, during the parasites' transmission from snail to amphipod. Trematode infected snails and amphipods were established together in experimental aquaria at temperatures of 15, 22 and 24°C for 9 d. Amphipod surface activity, survival rate, parasite prevalence, infection rate, and parasite distribution both within and between amphipod individuals were recorded during, or at the end of, the experiment. The snails' shedding rate of larval trematodes as a function of temperature was also examined. Increasing temperature resulted in higher infection levels and parasite-induced mortality in the amphipods, most likely governed by a similar temperature-dependent emergence of larval trematodes from the snails. No transmission occurred at 15°C, whereas at 24°C the parasite prevalence approached 100\% and the parasite-induced mortality exceeded 50\% in relation to controls. As assessed by the transparency of the amphipods' gills, infestation inflicted anaemia was the likely mechanism behind the increased surface activity observed among infected specimens. This parasite-induced behavioural change may facilitate transmission of infective stages to shorebird hosts feeding on C. volutator. The results demonstrate that microphallid trematodes are able to induce a significant additive mortality in C. volutator populations. The temperature mediated mortality emphasizes the potential significance of a density-independent process in controlling the impact of parasites on host organisms and thereby host population dynamics.]},

	abstract = {Invasive species can have profound impacts on communities and it is increasingly recognized that such effects may be mediated by parasitism. The ‘enemy release’ hypothesis posits that invaders may be successful and have high impacts owing to escape from parasitism. Alternatively, we hypothesize that parasites may increase host feeding rates and hence parasitized invaders may have increased community impacts. Here, we investigate the influence of parasitism on the predatory impact of the invasive freshwater amphipod
              Gammarus pulex
              . Up to 70 per cent of individuals are infected with the acanthocephalan parasite
              Echinorhynchus truttae
              , but parasitized individuals were no different in body condition to those unparasitized. Parasitized individuals consumed significantly more prey (
              Asellus aquaticus
              ; Isopoda) than did unparasitized individuals. Both parasitized and unparasitized individuals displayed Type-II functional responses (FRs), with the FR for parasitized individuals rising more steeply, with a higher asymptote, compared with unparasitized individuals. While the parasite reduced the fitness of individual females, we predict a minor effect on population recruitment because of low parasite prevalence in the peak reproductive period. The parasite thus has a large
              per capita
              effect on predatory rate but a low population fitness effect, and thus may enhance rather than reduce the impact of this invader.},

              infection was associated with
              G. d. celticus

              G. d. celticus
              also had a reduced ability to prey upon other co-occurring amphipods. We suggested the parasite may have pervasive influences on host ecology and behaviour. Here, we examine the association between
              P. mulleri
              parasitism and parameters influencing individual host fitness, behaviour and interspecific interactions. We also investigate the relationship between parasite prevalence and host population structure in the field. In our

              prevalence was strongly seasonal, ranging from 8·5\% in summer to 44·9\% in winter. The relative abundance of hosts with the heaviest parasite burden increased during summer, which coincided with high host mortality, suggesting that parasitism may regulate host abundance to some degree. Females were more likely to be parasitized than males and parasitized males were paired with smaller females than unparasitized males. Parasitism was associated with reduction in the host's activity level and reduced both its predation on the isopod

	abstract = {This study reports alterations in the drift behaviour of mayfly nymphs (Baetis bicaudatus) infected with the mermithid nematode parasite Gasteromermis sp. with respect to (i) their exposure to drift-feeding trout predators and (ii) the efficiency with which they locate food. Experimental stream channels and benthic and drift samples were combined to investigate drift behaviour. The drift behaviour of earlier instars did not differ between parasitized and unparasitized nymphs. Infected late-instar nymphs, however, drifted less frequently, drifted higher in the water column, and swam more frequently while drifting. Neither drift distances nor body angle while drifting were altered. Parasitized nymphs showed a reduction in food-location success in heterogeneous stream channels. The drift alterations therefore reduce both the exposure of the host to fish predators and the efficiency with which it locates food. The mayfly population is effectively divided into two groups: unparasitized nymphs (in which drift behaviour is of consequence to mayfly fecundity) and parasitized nymphs (in which drift behaviour is of consequence to mermithid survival and fecundity). It is suggested that locating food may be less important to the parasite, while the risk of trout predation may be higher for drifting parasitized individuals. Both of these factors would favour the parasite influencing its host to adopt lower drift frequencies.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
            
              In this paper, we describe the occurrence of a microsporidian parasite in female-biased populations of an intertidal amphipod,
              Corophium volutator
              (Pallas), at mudflat sites in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Sequence data for the parasite's 16S rDNA indicate that it is a novel microsporidian species. This parasite was found principally in female host gonads, indicating that it might be a vertically transmitted, sex-distorting microparasite. At 4 sites each sampled in early and mid-summer, parasite prevalence varied from 0 to 21\%. In the lab, infected mothers gave rise to more female-biased broods, than did uninfected mothers. Infection was not associated with size of females or with lowered survivorship of their young. Surprisingly, infected mothers actually had higher fertility controlling for body length than did uninfected mothers. Taken together, our results suggest that this novel microsporidian is likely a feminizing microparasite and is a contributing factor to local and widespread sex ratio distortion in
              C. volutator
              .},

The description of the benthic community within typological units of the Danube is based on the results from the Joint Danube Surveys. Species richness and abundance illustrate the structure and dominant groups of the benthic community. Furthermore the role of environmental impacts like hydromorphological changes, pollution, navigation as well as neozoa is shortly addressed and highlighted. In this context a conceptual framework of the multi-stressor complex of large rivers is introduced and discussed. Finally the biodiversity losses of selected species are reflected on a European scale.},

Eutrophication is a widespread problem that has an impact on water habitats and leads to the succession of sensitive species. Habitat degradation results in significant, predictable decreases in taxonomic diversity. We assessed benthic macroinvertebrate community structure (mainly families) in 9 rivers, 9 ponds, and 23 lakes in northeastern Poland. Mollusca, Annelida, Arthropoda, and Nemathelminthes were the 4 phyla represented, and 76 Insecta families, 5 taxa of Crustacea, and 12 Mollusca families were identified. A total of 91 taxa (mainly families) were recorded in all of the waterbodies studied. Diptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, and Gastropoda were the major components of the benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the aquatic habitats studied. The biodiversity values of the macroinvertebrate assemblages in the rivers and lakes studied were similar. This likely resulted from the similar number of habitats in both types of waters. Differences in biodiversity among the various waterbodies could be evidence of the moderate, diversified anthropogenic pressure to which they are subjected. The analysis of similarities indicated that in terms of the benthic macroinvertebrate communities, the waterbodies studied formed three groups, which, with just one exception, consisted separately of rivers, ponds, and lakes.},

              Gammarus duebeni
              , on host growth and survival under conditions of host–host competition and limited food. The parasite had no effect on host survival, but caused a reduction in juvenile growth. Stressful environmental conditions also led to a reduction in
              G. duebeni
              growth. However, we found no evidence to support the prediction that parasitized hosts would suffer a greater reduction in fitness than uninfected hosts under adverse environmental conditions. We interpret our results in the context of selection for successful vertical parasite transmission.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
            The phylum Microspora is ancient and diverse and affects a wide range of hosts. There is unusually high use of vertical transmission and this has significant consequences for transmission and pathogenicity. Vertical transmission is associated with low pathogenesis but nevertheless can have significant impact through associated traits such as sex ratio distortion. The majority of microsporidia have mixed transmission cycles and it is not clear whether they are able to modify their phenotype according to environmental circumstances. There is a great need to understand the mechanisms controlling transmission and one of the first challenges for the genomics era is to find genes associated with life cycle stages. Similarly we cannot currently predict the ease with which these parasites might switch between host groups. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that there are strong relationships between Microsporidia and their hosts. However closer typing of parasite isolates, in relation to host range and disease phenotype, is required to assess future environmental risk from these pathogens.},

              Gammarus roeselii
              Gervais, 1835 is a morphospecies with a wide distribution range in Europe. The Balkan Peninsula is known as an area of pre-Pleistocene cryptic diversification within this taxon, resulting in at least 13 Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs). The morphospecies diversified there during Neogene and has probably invaded other parts of the continent very recently, in postglacial or even historical times. Thus, the detailed goals of our study were to (1) identify which lineage(s) colonized Central-Western Europe (CWE), (2) determine their possible geographical origin, (3) verify, whether the colonisation was associated with demographic changes. In total, 663 individuals were sequenced for the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcoding fragment and 137 individuals for the internal transcribed spacer II (ITS2). We identified two MOTUs in the study area with contrasting Barcode Index Number and haplotype diversities. The Pannonian Basin (PB) appeared to be a potential ice age refugium for the species, while CWE was colonised by a single lineage (also present in PB), displaying low genetic diversity. Our results suggest that
              G. roeselii
              is a relatively recent coloniser in CWE, starting demographic expansion around 10 kya.},

G. roeselii is not usually considered to be a real threat to native gammarids because no evidence has been reported so far on its effects on biodiversity and habitats. In this study, we assessed the spatial distribution of G. roeselii in the secondary hydrographic system of the southern part of the sub-lacustrine Ticino River basin and examined substrate preferences on the basis of laboratory experiments. We found that G. roeselii is well established in this area, occurring in almost all the seminatural streams, reaching high densities. Furthermore, we found that this species has a preference for two distinct types of substrate: empty shells of the bivalve Corbicula fluminea, which provide a suitable shelter for the introduced amphipod, and aquatic plants, which provide food resources. Conversely, preference for inorganic substrates, such as stones, was lower. In addition, the results indicate that G. roeselii easily inhabits the water column. The high adaptability of G. roeselii, combined with its capacity to exploit different niches and its swimming ability, are ecological characteristics that can favour its colonisation of new areas.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  Local habitat and biological diversity of streams and rivers are strongly influenced by landform and land use within the surrounding valley at multiple scales. However, empirical associations between land use and stream response only varyingly succeed in implicating pathways of influence. This is the case for a number of reasons, including (a) covariation of anthropogenic and natural gradients in the landscape; (b) the existence of multiple, scale-dependent mechanisms; (c) nonlinear responses; and (d) the difficulties of separating present-day from historical influences. Further research is needed that examines responses to land use under different management strategies and that employs response variables that have greater diagnostic value than many of the aggregated measures in current use.
            In every respect, the valley rules the stream.

	abstract = {Abstract. Glaciers and ice sheets host abundant and dynamic communities of
microorganisms on the ice surface (supraglacial environments). Recently, it
has been shown that Streptophyte glacier algae blooming on the surface ice
of the south-western coast of the Greenland Ice Sheet are a significant
contributor to the 15-year marked decrease in albedo. Currently, little is
known about the constraints, such as nutrient availability, on this
large-scale algal bloom. In this study, we investigate the relative
abundances of dissolved inorganic and dissolved organic macronutrients (N
and P) in these darkening surface ice environments. Three distinct ice
surfaces, with low, medium and high visible impurity loadings, supraglacial
stream water and cryoconite hole water, were sampled. Our results show a
clear dominance of the organic phase in all ice surface samples containing
low, medium and high visible impurity loadings, with 93 \% of the total
dissolved nitrogen and 67 \% of the total dissolved phosphorus in the
organic phase. Mean concentrations in low, medium and high visible impurity
surface ice environments are 0.91, 0.62 and 1.0 µM for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), 5.1, 11 and 14 µM for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), 0.03, 0.07 and 0.05 µM for dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and 0.10, 0.15 and 0.12 µM for dissolved organic phosphorus
(DOP), respectively. DON concentrations in all three surface ice samples are
significantly higher than DON concentrations in supraglacial streams and
cryoconite hole water (0 and 0.7 µM, respectively). DOP
concentrations are higher in all three surface ice samples compared to
supraglacial streams and cryoconite hole water (0.07 µM for both).
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations increase with the amount of
visible impurities present (low: 83 µM, medium: 173 µM and
high: 242 µM) and are elevated compared to supraglacial streams and
cryoconite hole water (30 and 50 µM, respectively). We
speculate that the architecture of the weathering crust, which impacts on
water flow paths and storage in the melting surface ice and/or the
production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), containing both N
and P in conjunction with C, is responsible for the temporary retention of
DON and DOP in the melting surface ice. The unusual presence of measurable DIP
and DIN, principally as NH4+, in the melting surface ice
environments suggests that factors other than macronutrient limitation are
controlling the extent and magnitude of the glacier algae.},
